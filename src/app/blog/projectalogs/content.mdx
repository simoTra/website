# Streamline Your 3D Printing Workflow with Projectalogs

Managing multiple 3D printing jobs, projects, and clients can quickly become overwhelming. Projectalogs offers a centralized platform to simplify this process, allowing users to efficiently track their 3D printing activities while keeping everything organized and accessible.

## Core Features

Projectalogs is designed to bring together all aspects of 3D printing management in one place. Key features include:

- Grouping print jobs by project and associating them with specific clients.
- Providing detailed analytics on job costs and performance.
- Offering a user-friendly dashboard for real-time insights and statistics.

## Seamless Integration with 3D Printer Interfaces

One of the standout features of Projectalogs is its deep integration with Klipper-based interfaces like Fluidd and Mainsail. This integration allows users to assign jobs to projects directly from the printerâ€™s interface. By eliminating the need for manual job imports and data entry, this feature saves time and reduces the risk of errors.

## Why Centralization Matters

Having a single platform to manage clients, projects, and jobs provides significant benefits:

- Efficiency: No more juggling multiple tools or manually tracking project details.
- Organization: All job data, client information, and project analytics are available at a glance.
- Scalability: As your workload grows, Projectalogs ensures you stay on top of everything without added complexity.

## Current Capabilities and Future Plans

While Projectalogs is currently in its early stages, its foundational features, such as CRUD operations for managing clients, jobs, and projects, are fully functional. Future updates will further enhance analytics and expand integration capabilities to support even more seamless workflows.
