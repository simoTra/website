# My Blog

Welcome to the repository for my personal blog! This is where I share ideas, projects, and insights, with a focus on technology, DIY, and more. Below you can find details about the project structure, technology stack, and plans for future updates.

## Why I Changed the Site
The previous design of the blog had its charm but felt out of place—it didn’t represent my vision anymore. The new version emphasizes minimalism and flat design. It serves as a solid base to experiment and evolve over time.

## Features
- **Minimal and Flat Design**: Clean and distraction-free interface.
- **Faster Performance**: Optimized stack with less overhead.
- **Flexibility for Experiments**: A foundation to try new features and designs easily.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (Currently using version 13, but will be updated soon)
- **Template**: Based on [Aceternity UI](https://pro.aceternity.com/products/sidefolio-portfolio-template).
- **Styling**: TailwindCss and Framer Motion.
- **Hosting**: Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
- **Image Optimization**: Integrated with Next.js Image component.

## Future Plans
1. Upgrade to the latest Next.js version.
2. Add more dynamic features (e.g., a search bar or tag filters).
3. Continue optimizing performance and usability.
4. Experiment with custom themes and interactive elements.
